===== Installing Periscope =====

Periscope can be easily install by:
    sudo python setup.py install
or
    sudo python setup.py develop

If you're planning to manually install Periscope by other methods, see the
following sections for required packages.

===== Auth Notes =====

UNIS and the MS may enable SSL as well as ABAC authorization support, see
settings.py for details.

SSL dependencies should already be met by setup above.  If in doubt, verify that
python-ssl and M2Crypto are installed.

For ABAC auth (ENABLE_AUTH=True), two additional dependencies are required:

1. GCF/Omni libraries available from http://trac.gpolab.bbn.com/gcf/wiki/GettingGcf

Once the GCF tarball is extracted, set GCF_PATH in settings.py as appropriate.

2. ABAC python install

The ABAC libraries and installation instructions are available at:

http://abac.deterlab.net

and

http://abac.deterlab.net/browser/doc/INSTALL?rev=mei_rt2

You also need to build strongswan and Yap as dependencies as outlined in the
link above.

To allow the use of proxy certificates, ensure the following is done before
starting Periscope:

1. Edit /usr/local/etc/strongswan.conf to include

libstrongswan {
        x509 {
                enforce_critical = no
        }
} 

2. Set OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1 in the environment, e.g.:

export OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1
or
setenv OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS 1


===== Installing MongoDB =====
Please note that Periscope uses mongodb

You can find instructions how to download mongodb here:

For Debian based distros:
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian-or-ubuntu-linux/

For Redhat based distros:
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-redhat-centos-or-fedora-linux/

If your server is located on host other than localhost, please edit settings.py

Running Periscope:
To run periscope
    periscoped     # It runs on port 8888 by default
or
    periscoped --port=80
    


Running Periscope with nginx:

If you're planning to run periscope in a production environment, it's a good 
idea to load balance between mulitple instance of persicope on one server.
The following is an example nginx configuratioin


###########################nginx.conf##########################################

user www-data;
worker_processes  1;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

	location / {

            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://frontends;
        }
    }
}
